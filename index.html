        <h1 class="IntroH1">About</h1>
        <p>
        My name is <b>Pratham Patel</b> and I am a Sophomore at the University of Pittburgh.
        Outside of classes, I <b>love to read, solve puzzles, work my mind, workout, and go on runs</b>.
        I am currently studying <b>Computer Science</b> with a minor in Chemistry.
        I love a good challenge, whether that's in the form of a math question or a puzzle or if it's in the form of a CS project,
        I'll get the job done. I have created this website as a way to showcase my skills, my interests, my goals, what I have accomplished, and most importantly,
        myself.

              <h2>Website</h2>
              <p>
                This website was originally just a side project, but it has quickly grown to one of my most favorite projects
                as it represents me and my artistic creativity.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Proj2">
              <h2>Email Client</h2>
              <p>
                A program to mass-email a customized email to multiple people with a personal flair included. The user can
                add the recipients name or any other information through a CSV.
            </p>

            <div class="Proj3">
              <h2>Habits Track</h2>
              <p>
                Inspired by Habitica, I created a terminal-based system that rewards you with 'gold' for
                being productive. You can spend this goal for recreational activities or to feel less guilty about your indulgances.

              <h2>Boggle Java</h2>
              <p>
                I made a recursive program in Java that returns all 3+ letter words from a 10x10 board of random letters. Words are cross-checked
                against a provided dictionary. This was for CS 0445 during Fall of Freshman year.
              </p>

            <div class="Proj5">
              <h2>DLB Search Engine</h2>
              <p>
                For my Algorithms class, I made a search engine, complete with user history, that would produce results in logarithmic time.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Proj6">
              <h2>Centipede</h2>
              <p>I had to follow all of the conventional rules and game mechanics, but was free to add other small tidbits to make the game more enjoyable.
            I ended up adding native MIPS sounds using syscall 31 with various parameters. This was for CS 0447 during Fall of Sophomore year.</p>

          <h2>Code Ninjas</h2>
          <p class="CNPara">
            I had the opportunity to teach young children how to create video games in
            <b>JavaScript</b>. We used <b>Code Ninja</b>'s Game Development Platform (GDP).
            I primarily worked with children between the <b>ages of 5 and 13</b> with a focus on the
            older children who were creating more complex video games. I collaborated with the other Sensei's and made sure that
            all of the children were being helped but also learning. As this was during COVID, we had to introduce a hybrid environment
            where certain students would be online only whereas others would come in-person. I dealt mainly with the in-person children
            and was able to help them hands-on.

            I am currently a <b>Research Assistant under Dr. Hansruedi Mathys</b>.
            We currently work with a dataset provided by Rush University, where we analyze
            <b>GigaBytes of data</b> and try to find out more about <b>Alzheimer's Disease</b>.
            We are currently trying to understand the cellular and molecular underlyings of AD
            and why certain people have a natural resistance to it. I have been working under Dr. Mathys since
            <b>Summer 2021</b> and have the opportunity to <b>lead my own project</b> within his research. I worked with other
            students and fellows in order to <b>develop my own python script</b> analyzing the presence of senescent (toxic) cells.
            Other than that project, we have <b>developed and modified many of our own/others scripts</b> as this lab is a mix between
            <b>computational biology and neuroscience</b>.

        <p>
          Outside of school, I love to keep myself busy. I am a <b>passionate amateur photographer.</b> I run an instagram account where I share my photos with the world, <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/2p_snaps/" target="_blank">@2p_snaps</a></b>.
          I use lightroom to edit my photos, primarily focusing on landscape, flowers, urban areas, and the beautiful bridges of Pittsburgh. Although I've ammassed a small following on Instagram,
          my main inspiration comes from the fact that I do this for fun and I love to see how my pictures have grown in style. I've included some of the picture I've taken below :).
          I also run a <b><a href="https://livingaseasonedlife.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Blog</a> on the side with my best friend</b>, where we write about our personal life, education, living life as a first-generation American, and much more.
          I love to let my creativity run free, expressing it through my photographs, writing, and anything else that makes me feel free.

        <p>
          I would love for you to contact me, I'm currently open to <b>Internships, part-time or temporary job offers,</b> or <b>any kind of learning experience.</b> I have linked my <a href="https://github.com/patelpratham11", target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratham-patel-38a348185/", target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="mailto:prp48@pitt.edu">email</a>,
          and you're already at my personal website. I wish to eventually join a company as a <b>Software Developer</b>, but I know that there are many applications for my skills
          and I want to be able to explore my options before committing to a single subfield.
          Thank you for viewing my website all the way through. I hope I was able to showcase both myself and my skills through this page,
          feel free to contact me for whatever reason and I hope you have a great day.
