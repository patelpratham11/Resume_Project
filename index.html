        <p>
        My name is Pratham Patel and <b>I</b> am a Sophomore at the University of Pittburgh.
        Outside of classes, I <b>love</b> to read, solve puzzles, work my mind, workout, and go on runs.
        I am currently studying <b>Computer Science</b> with a minor in Chemistry.
        I love a good challenge, whether that's in the form of a math question or a puzzle or if it's in the form of a CS project,
        I'll get the job done. I have created this website as a way to showcase my skills, my interests, my goals, what I have accomplished, and most importantly,
        myself.

        I love to always have some kind of project going on. Whether that's for class or just for a random challenge, I'm always working on something.
        I really enjoy the challenge aspect of it. Here are some projects that I have worked on...
        </p>

        <div class="first">
            <!-- <h2>Academic</h2> -->
              <div class="one"><b>Atari Centipede</b> <br> <br>I was tasked with making a MIPS-version of the famous Atari game, Centipede.
              I had to follow all of the conventional rules and game mechanics, but was free to add other small tidbits to make the game more enjoyable.
            I ended up adding native MIPS sounds using syscall 31 with various parameters. This was for CS 0447 during Fall of Sophomore year.</div>

            <div class="two"><b>Boggle in Java</b><br><br>I made a recursive program in Java that returns all 3+ letter words from a 10x10 board of random letters. Words are cross-checked
            against a provided dictionary. This was for CS 0445 during Fall of Freshman year.</div>
            </div>
      <div class="second">
        <!-- <h2>Personal</h2> -->
          <div class="three"><b><a href="https://github.com/patelpratham11/BookBot"></a>BookBot</b><br><br>You can look email multiple files to a single email to a single person, after which the entire directory will be wiped clean.
            I made this mainly for my kindle. This was a personal project, developed in Winter of 2021.</div>
          <div class="four"><b><a href="https://github.com/patelpratham11/PythonEmailClient"></a>EmailClient</b><br><br>Use a simple CSV file to send personalized messages to countless people,
            complete with HTML signatures. This was a personal project I developed for my father in Spring of 2021. </div>
      </div>
      <div class="third">
        **Unfortunately, since these projects were for graded assignments, I am unable to keep the source code public.

      <p>
        Outside of school, I love to keep myself busy. I am a <b>passionate amateur photographer.</b> I run an instagram account where I share my photos with the world, <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/2p_snaps/" target="_blank">@2p_snaps</a></b>.
        I use lightroom to edit my photos, primarily focusing on landscape, flowers, urban areas, and the beautiful bridges of Pittsburgh.
        I also run a <b><a href="https://livingaseasonedlife.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Blog</a> on the side with my best friend </b>, where we write about our personal life, education, living life as a first-generation American, and much more.
        I love to let my creativity run free, expressing it through my photographs, writing, and anything else that makes me feel free.
