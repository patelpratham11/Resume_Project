        <p>
        My name is <b>Pratham Patel</b> and I am a Sophomore at the University of Pittburgh.
        Outside of classes, I <b>love to read, solve puzzles, work my mind, workout, and go on runs</b>.
        I am currently studying <b>Computer Science</b> with a minor in Chemistry.
        I love a good challenge, whether that's in the form of a math question or a puzzle or if it's in the form of a CS project,
        I'll get the job done. I have created this website as a way to showcase my skills, my interests, my goals, what I have accomplished, and most importantly,
        myself.

                This website was originally just a side project, but it has quickly grown to one of my most favorite projects
                as it represents me and my artistic creativity.

                A program to mass-email a customized email to multiple people with a personal flair included. The user can

              <p>
                Inspired by Habitica, I created a terminal-based system that rewards you with 'gold' for
                being productive. You can spend this goal for recreational activities or to feel less guilty about your indulgances.

                I made a recursive program in Java that returns all 3+ letter words from a 10x10 board of random letters. Words are cross-checked
                against a provided dictionary. This was for CS 0445 during Fall of Freshman year.

            I ended up adding native MIPS sounds using syscall 31 with various parameters. This was for CS 0447 during Fall of Sophomore year.</p>

            I also had the opportunity to spend a <b>summer as an intern at PNC bank.</b> I was

            I was placed on this team in order to <b>collaborate, present, identify, report, and manage risks</b>
            that were surrounding the data. Our <b>main objective was to effective manage and mitigate risks surrounding
            incomplete and inaccurate data</b>. I assisted new programs set out by PNC regarding data use, data risks, and data quality. I worked heavily with the Analytics Competency Center and Model Risk Management throughout my various projects.
            We heavily leveraged database-related technologies such as Excel, Hadoop, and some SQL.

            We are currently trying to understand the cellular and molecular underlyings of AD

            <b>Summer 2021</b> and have the opportunity to <b>lead my own project</b> within his research. I worked with other
            students and fellows in order to <b>develop my own python script</b> analyzing the presence of senescent (toxic) cells.
            Other than that project, we have <b>developed and modified many of our own/others scripts</b> as this lab is a mix between

            I had the opportunity to teach young children how to create video games in
            <b>JavaScript</b>. We used <b>Code Ninja</b>'s Game Development Platform (GDP).
            I primarily worked with children between the <b>ages of 5 and 13</b> with a focus on the
            older children who were creating more complex video games. I collaborated with the other Sensei's and made sure that
            all of the children were being helped but also learning. As this was during COVID, we had to introduce a hybrid environment
            where certain students would be online only whereas others would come in-person. I dealt mainly with the in-person children
            and was able to help them hands-on.

        <p>
          Outside of school, I love to keep myself busy. I am a <b>passionate amateur photographer.</b> I run an instagram account where I share my photos with the world, <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/2p_snaps/" target="_blank">@2p_snaps</a></b>.
          I use lightroom to edit my photos, primarily focusing on landscape, flowers, urban areas, and the beautiful bridges of Pittsburgh. Although I've ammassed a small following on Instagram,
          my main inspiration comes from the fact that I do this for fun and I love to see how my pictures have grown in style. I've included some of the picture I've taken below :).
          I love to let my creativity run free, expressing it through my photographs, writing, and anything else that makes me feel free.
