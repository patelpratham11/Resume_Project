        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        My name is Pratham Patel and <b>I</b> am a Sophomore at the University of Pittburgh.
        Outside of classes, I <b>love</b> to read, solve puzzles, work my mind, workout, and go on runs.
        I am currently studying <b>Computer Science</b> with a minor in Chemistry.
        I love a good challenge, whether that's in the form of a math question or a puzzle or if it's in the form of a CS project,
        I'll get the job done.
